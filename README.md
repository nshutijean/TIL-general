## This is my TIL repo of every cool thing i learnt
-----

Okay this is not an everyday thing though😑 But i try to make it everyday😎 (Nice punchline bro)

I will be trying to write about JS/VueJs for frontend dev, PHP/Laravel for backend dev, and Dart/Flutter for mobile dev 😢😭😭 But also on other cool things this discipline has to offer like AR/VR and other Software Engineering related things.

I'm alive on [twitter](https://twitter.com/kintsugi_boy) so follow me there and say something cool about me😂😂😂

I think i love emojis😭
