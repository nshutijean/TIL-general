## This is my TIL repo of every cool thing i learnt

Okay this is not an everyday thing though😑 But i try to make it everyday😎

I will be trying to write about JS/VueJs for frontend dev, PHP/Laravel for backend dev, and Dart/Flutter for mobile dev. But also on other cool things this discipline has to offer like AR/VR and other Software Engineering related things.
