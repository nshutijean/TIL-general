## Navigation in flutter
---------------

Flutter Newbie hereðŸ˜‚ So today i got to learn about Navigator stack(which programmatically helps to navigate routes). I think there is something like this in VuejsðŸ¤”

So, <b>Navigator Widget</b> manages a set of child widgets as a stack(with push() and pop()).
These children are the various screens of your apps, which are called routes in Flutter.

Even the MaterialApp widget which starts everything, is child which is pushed to Navigator

To make your route visible on Navigator, you push it and pop it whenever you want to go
to the previous one.

Navigator.push(context);
Navigator.pop(context);

For instance you can create routes like this so that you can navigate them by name:

```dart
routes : <String, WidgetBuilder> {
 "/sports" : (BuildContext bc) => Page(title : "Sports"),
 "/politics" : (BuildContext bc) => Page(title : "Politics"),
}
```

And now you can navigate to one of them:
 
 ``` Navigator.pushNamed(context, "/birthdays");```
