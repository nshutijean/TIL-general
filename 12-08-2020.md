**Prerequisite**: VueJs

Some of the terms: SEO, Meta tags, SSR (google them and see)

Why should you choose Nuxt?
-----

**SSR**: Server running, which will create an html response, and be served to the client. An API call is made on the serve, metadata are set and the page is served

**Code-splitting**: only the code that is need on that specific page will be downloaded

**Performance**: by rendering pages on a server pages load faster. when the network is slow, only the downloaded code will be used

**Metatags**: because nuxt app can be rendered on the server, when the crawlers read a page, it's already been processed and the meta information has been appended.

Some of its directories:

- *assets* dir holds uncompiled files(sass) or images
- *middleware* dir: defines f(x)s that are used before or after a page/s is/are rendered
- *pages* dir: views(with their routes) and routes
- *plugins* dir: where components, constants are globally registered
- *static* dir: holds files that are automatically mapped to the server's root
- *store* dir: contains vuex store(disabled by default)

#### Useful Tips:

Layout dir components are top-level components(more like App.vue)

Global css/sass file might also stored in assets dir

A component that might be permanently shown on the page(navbar, footer, sidebar) is stored in the layout dir

Dynamic routes or components are shown by an underscore( _ ). For example, **_slug.vue** component in a posts dir will be seen after being rendered as **posts/slug_of_that_specific_post**, and access it through route params
 

- Use head() method to set the HTML tag to the current page, it return an object
