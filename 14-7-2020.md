### Software Versioning ###
---------------------

<em>It is the process of assigning either unique version names or unique version numbers to unique states of a software.</em>

 - The bigger your system grows and the more packages you integrate into your software, the more likely you are to find yourself, one day, in this pit of despairðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

The normal used method of version contains of a X.Y.Z format, which corresponds to <b>major.minor.patch</b> respectively.

 - <b>Major version</b> numbers/names are changed due to a signifant change being taken(e.g: incompatible API changes)
 - <b>Minor version</b> change occurs when there is a feature or a bunch features are introduced(functionality)
 - <b>Patch version</b> numbers are changed whenever there is a new build to the software or a bug fix
