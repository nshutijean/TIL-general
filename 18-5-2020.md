## Problem Solving
-----
4 steps:
> - Understand the problem
> - Devise the plan
> - Implement the solution
> - Verify the solution

Devising the plan can be divided into phases:
> - Research for an existing solution
> - Adapt it to our existing case

Research phase identifies preexisting solutions for problems similar to the one under examination using some resources like: StackOverflow, Quora, etc

The Adapt phase looks at optimizing the solution found so that it better fits our own problem.

#### "Take your time to understand the problem and to research available solutions"

Issues with the adaptation phase:
> - <b>Lack of self-confidence</b> : You actually have a valid solution, but you think it is not good enough
> - <b>Overconfidenced</b> : You quickly find a solution, and you think it is the best invention since sliced bread

Cause: Subjective bias <br>
Solution: <b>"When creating or adapting a solution, consider its merits objectively"</b>

<b>Implementation:</b> (Inevitable) <br>
<b>Verification: </b>The verification step can help the engineer to build their gut feel for good solutions. <br>
#### "Remember to learn from past experience"


Keeping an eye on issue raised and code review feedback are also useful here.

What's more to this:
> - Expand your horizon:<br>
     - Consider joining an open source project
> - Challenge yourself: Via sites like CoderByte and HackerRank
> - Build something new: Start from scratch, build a new app and open source your code.
