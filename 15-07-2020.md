## Event.Target
---------
<em>The target property of the Event interface is a reference to the object onto which the event was dispatched</em>

Syntax: <br> ```var myTarjet = event.target;```   

Stepping a little back, what is the Event interface?
- The Event interface is used to provide contextual information about an event to the handler processing the event ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘

Okay ```preventDefault()``` method happens to be a method of the Event interface, which is used to signify that an event should be cancelled

And here is an exampleðŸ˜‰ Using Vuejs, you can view an uploaded image information via the console using ```event.target```:

```html
<template>
    <div>
        <input type="file" @change="takeImage">
    </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
    data() {
        return {
            selectedImage: null
        }
    },
    methods: {
        takeImage(event) {
            this.selectedImage = event.target.files[0];
            console.log(this.selectedImage);
        }
    },
}
</script>
```
